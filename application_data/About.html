Ethnic groups around the world increasingly make claims for internal autonomy or even outright secession. Self-determination claims have led to the formation of more than 20 new states since 1945 and more than 100 autonomy regimes. But self-determination claims can also sow the seeds for armed conflict: more than half of all internal armed conflicts since 1945 have been fought over self-determination.
The SDM 2.0 dataset aims to cover all non-colonial self-determination movements around the world, 1945-2020. All in all, the dataset includes information on 502 self-determination movements in 124 countries. 268 of the 502 self-determination movements have made claims for outright secession, and 134 have engaged in armed conflict with the state.

<h4>What is a self-determination movement?</h4>
SDM 2.0 defines self-determination movements as a collection of one or more political organizations that are connected to an ethnic group and make politically significant claims for increased self-determination from the state. To be included in the dataset, self-determination claims need to cross a minimum threshold of political significance. SDM 2.0 does not include colonial liberation movements.


<h4>Type of self-determination claims</h4>
Different self-determination movements make different claims against the state. SDM 2.0 distinguishes between four types of self-determination claims: claims for the establishment of regional autonomy; claims for the internal separation of a territory from an existing autonomous region (sub-state secession); claims for the establishment of a new independent state; and claims for the merger with another, already existing independent state (irredentism). Movements may make multiple claims at the same time. The Map shows the dominant (i.e. most popular) claim in any given year.


<h4>Claimed territory</h4>
Self-determination claims as defined here necessarily relate to territory. Via its GeoSDM extension, SDM 2.0 provides information on the territory that self-determination movements are claiming. If movements disagree internally on the territory they are claiming, SDM 2.0 records the dominant (i.e., most popular) claim.


<h4>Armed conflict</h4>
Self-determination movements are considered to be in armed conflict with the state if there is a violent intra-state conflict that confronts incumbent governments with nonstate political and military organizations (the rebels), involves the use of armed force, and is fought over territorial self-rule. The violence needs to be reciprocated and lead to at least 25 deaths in a calendar year. If the death count drops below 25, armed conflict is coded as ongoing if violence is sustained and the 25 deaths threshold is reached again within one or maximally two years. Periods of armed conflict are indicated with a Fire symbol in the Map.


<h4>Why are some countries not included in the map?</h4>
The map only shows countries that had at least one active self-determination movement, 1945-2020.


<h4>Data collection</h4>
SDM 2.0 was created by Dr Micha Germann (University of Bath). The GeoSDM extension was created by Dr Micha Germann, Victoria Puglia (United Nations C4ISR Academy for Peace Operations, formerly University of Oxford), and Dr Guy Schvitz (Joint Research Centre of the European Commission, formerly ETH Zurich).
It would not have been possible to create SDM 2.0 without the help of a dedicated team of research assistants, including: Alejandro Posada Tellez, Alex Moodie, Ana Verdnik, Andreas Karoutas, Ilyas Yesdauletov, Jaida Keaveney, Jakob Schram, Jonathan Seel, Juhong Park, Qianru Hu, Ruolan Gan, Sarah Clowry, Sean Garrett, Silvia Genovese, Stephen Murray, and Wangyin Zhao.
SDM 2.0 builds on and extends the first version of the SDM dataset. The SDM 1.0 project was led by Prof Nicholas Sambanis (Yale University), Dr Micha Germann (University of Bath), and Dr Andreas Schädel (Berghof Foundation, formerly ETH Zurich).


<h4>Sources</h4>
SDM 2.0 and its GeoSDM extension are based on a large number of sources, including but not limited to: various encyclopediae of separatist movements, stateless nations, and ethnic groups; academic books and articles; newspaper articles; reports by reputable international non-governmental organizations, such as International Crisis Group or Human Rights Watch; and various existing databases, such as the Ethnic Power Relations (EPR) dataset, the Minorities at Risk (MAR) dataset, or the Uppsala/PRIO Armed Conflict dataset. The exact sources used on a case-by-case basis can be accessed by clicking on the Coding Notes icon in the Map.


<h4>Funding</h4>
SDM 2.0 was made possible through funding from the UK’s Economic and Social Research Council (grant reference: <a href="https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=ES%2FW000598%2F1" style="color: white;">ES/W000598/1</a>).


<h4>Additional information and data</h4>
All data shown will be free to download as of the publication of the first article emanating from the project. This includes information on a large number of additional concepts not shown in the map, such as information on state responses to self-determination movements in the form of concessions and restrictions of ethnic rights, whether self-determination groups have representation in the central state’s executive and a meaningful level of regional autonomy, the demographic size of groups, unilateral sovereignty declarations, as well as further information on the territories claimed by self-determination movements (e.g., their size, proximity to international land borders, or economic value).
